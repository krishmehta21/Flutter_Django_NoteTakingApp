# 📝 **Notes App**

This project is a simple **Notes Application** that utilizes a **Django backend** and a **Flutter frontend**. The application allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on notes. Users can easily manage their notes with a seamless experience provided by the **Flutter** mobile interface.

## ✨ **Description**

The **Notes App** demonstrates a full-stack architecture where **Django** serves as the backend API and **Flutter** provides the mobile frontend. **Django** handles data storage and retrieval with a **SQLite database**, while **Flutter** offers an intuitive UI for note management.

### ✨ **Features**

- 🖊️ **Create**: Users can add new notes by entering text content.
- 📄 **Retrieve**: Retrieve all notes or individual notes by their unique identifier.
- ✏️ **Update**: Modify existing notes with updated content.
- 🗑️ **Delete**: Remove notes that are no longer needed.

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

Follow these instructions to set up both the **Django backend** and the **Flutter frontend**.

### 🔧 **Backend Setup (Django)**

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure **Python**, **pip**, **Django**, and `django-cors-headers` are installed.
   ```bash
   pip install django django-cors-headers
   ```
2. **Create Django Project**: Initialize a new Django project and create a Django app for managing notes.
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject notes_backend
   cd notes_backend
   django-admin startapp notes
   ```
3. **Configure CORS**: Enable CORS for local development in your `settings.py`.
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # other apps
       'corsheaders',
   ]

   MIDDLEWARE = [
       'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
       # other middlewares
   ]

   CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True
   ```
4. **Set Up Models and Views**: Define models to represent notes and views to handle CRUD operations.
5. **Run the Django Server**: Start the development server to serve the API.
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### 📱 **Frontend Setup (Flutter)**

1. **Install Flutter**: Follow the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started) to install and set up Flutter on your machine.
2. **Integrate HTTP Package**: Use the `http` package to make API calls to the Django backend.
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     http: ^0.13.3
   ```
3. **Create UI Components**: Design screens for creating, displaying, updating, and deleting notes.
4. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**: Use state management to handle API calls and manage loading states.
5. **Test on Emulator or Device**: Run the app on an emulator or physical device for a smooth user experience.
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## ⚙️ **Running the Application**

To run the **Notes App**, you’ll need to start both the **Django backend** and the **Flutter frontend**. Ensure they communicate over HTTP.

1. Start the **Django server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. Run the **Flutter app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 📂 **Project Structure**

- **`notes_backend/`**: Django project folder containing backend settings and configurations.
- **`notes_backend/notes/`**: Django app folder for managing models, views, and serializers for the notes.
- **`flutter_app/`**: Flutter project folder containing the Dart code for UI and business logic.

## 🔗 **API Endpoints**

- **GET** `/notes/`: Retrieve all notes.
- **GET** `/notes/<id>/`: Retrieve a specific note by ID.
- **POST** `/notes/create/`: Create a new note.
- **PUT** `/notes/<id>/update/`: Update an existing note by ID.
- **DELETE** `/notes/<id>/delete/`: Delete a note by ID.

These endpoints are consumed by the **Flutter app** to perform CRUD operations on notes stored in the **Django backend**.
